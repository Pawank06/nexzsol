# Nexzsol: Decentralized GitHub Contributions

Nexzsol is a revolutionary platform that bridges the gap between open-source contributions and cryptocurrency rewards. By leveraging Solana blockchain and GitHub OAuth, we provide a seamless experience for both contributors and maintainers to participate in and manage bounty programs.
